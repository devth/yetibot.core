  "Major components of the parser:
   expr     - the top-level expression made up of cmds and sub-exprs. When multiple
              cmds are present, it implies they should be successively piped.
   cmd      - a single command consisting of words.
   sub-expr - a backticked or $(..)-style sub-expression to be evaluated inline.
   parened  - a grouping of words wrapped in parenthesis, explicitly tokenized to
              allow parenthesis in cmds and disambiguate between sub-expression
              syntax.
   literal  - a grouping of any characters but quote surrounded by quotes.
              Allows the use of pipes and any other special characters to be
              treated as literal rather than being parsed."

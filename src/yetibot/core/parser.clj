  "Major components of the parser:
   expr     - the top-level expression made up of cmds and sub-exprs. When multiple
              cmds are present, it implies they should be successively piped.
   cmd      - a single command consisting of words.
   sub-expr - a backticked or $(..)-style sub-expression to be evaluated inline.
   parened  - a grouping of words wrapped in parenthesis, explicitly tokenized to
              allow parenthesis in cmds and disambiguate between sub-expression
              syntax.
   literal  - a grouping of any characters but quote surrounded by quotes.
              Allows the use of pipes and any other special characters to be
              treated as literal rather than being parsed."

;;
;; 1. always break :expr trees into separate parse trees to be evaluated
;;    separately
;; 2. the output of the first :expr gets propagated as input to the next :expr -
;;
;; note that we need to propagate all :result/* fields:
;; - :result/value
;; - :result/data
;; - :result/error
